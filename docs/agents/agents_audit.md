# agents_audit.md

Authority: README.md is the single product truth.

## What was inferred from README.md
- Governance agents map to the engines and product areas explicitly listed in README.md.
- Authority hierarchy follows README.md as supreme product truth.

## What was ambiguous in README.md
- Exact data schemas for users, memberships, shifts, and financial records.
- Exact API definitions and integration protocols beyond named systems.
- Detailed UX flows for each workflow state and conflict resolution path.
- Legal jurisdiction specifics for labor law enforcement.
- Target vertical for the Phase 1 MVP.
- Offline-first synchronization rules and conflict handling for mobile.
- Reputation scoring inputs, dispute handling, and pricing rules for the marketplace.
- Financial accounting assumptions (taxes, overtime rules, cost attribution).

## What cannot be safely implemented yet
- Any application code or feature details not explicitly defined in README.md.
- Any AI model selection, training data, or evaluation criteria beyond the stated metrics.

## Where human decisions are required
- Prioritization within roadmap phases if conflicts arise.
- Compliance scope by region and industry standards beyond ISO 27001 roadmap.
- Marketplace policies for dispute resolution and insurance integration details.
